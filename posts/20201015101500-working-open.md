# Unlearning through Working Open

An umbrella repository containing thoughts, notes, and links on working open in the OpenDoTT project.

Welcome to my journey of working open. This collection of thoughts, ideas, notes, and links is an effort to make my personal learning more accessible. It also marks a the time when we—the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org)—started the project phase of [Internet Health](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/internet-health/).

_Working open_ is an essential part of this.

I have worked in the open before in a way, publishing code on Github https://github.com/jens-a-e and https://github.com/muthesius and on Gitlab https://gitlab.com/maschinentexte and https://gitlab.com/opendott/was.

The aim of this endeavour is to share while I am working and invite critique and feedback form a wider audience.

This is the start.
