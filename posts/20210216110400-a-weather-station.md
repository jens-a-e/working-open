# A Weather Station

A weather/pollution sensing unit (Jens Ewald, Northumbria University)
Who is the character (a paragraph)
A little weather station with simple, essential, sensors:
Rain
Wind
Temperature
Recording the weather diligently everyday.
A sensor that makes it special is the water temperature.
Its cousin is out at sea by a lighthouse.
The cousin’s water temperature sensor turned numb a couple of weeks ago.
A slow narrator, being used to see far every day.

What’s its context and environment (a paragraph)
Up on one of the highest buildings in the city.
It is spread all around the building, even down into the water.
Near the water. A 360 degree view to see the weather coming from all directions.
Catching rain.
They can’t move.
The cousins became experts of Zen; the calm; just wait.
However, they notice the cult of numbers when the water temperature sensor breaks out at sea.

So the story goes:

Winter days are dreek from time to time in this area. There is fog coming in in the morning making it hard to see where the sun cuts across the horizon. I can alway tell the temperature and where the wind comes from—there is always wind here. I put that in my storage. The house I am build on and around can be asked about what I have measured. There are other things in there which keep an archive. They come and go. New kids on the block. New shiny other things convince the house they are better at archiving and showing what I record. Well, that is a totally different story.

Others are looking at us from many places. How many degrees they ask, the degrees of wind, how many drops of rain? All of those questions… “Us” I say? Yes, sorry, I get side tracked from time to time when there is no change in the conditions and the wind is mellow. I have a cousin out at sea by the lighthouse. Tough place that is. I say, there is always wind here. Just imagine out there. Heavy winds. From time to time me and my cousin wonder why those who ask won’t go and see for themselves. This mood is very likely in the winter when the nights are long and the days are short. We have to wait long in the mornings for the sun to warm our shells, have the wind spin the cups of the sensor a bit and have a change from the night to the day. The sunrises are sometimes … well, carried away again.

Where was I? Yes, my cousin had its water sensor turn numb. “It’s alright” was the calm response. “It’s getting colder. That I can feel. I trust my cables to know”. The others started to write to us, ask again, and again. But my cousin could not tell other than: colder, warmer, like yesterday. The services, the people, the other things, weather stations—all of them thought my cousin was broken or even passed away. It was hard for them to not have numbers. I could feel the water temperature still. I could see the winter swimmers getting in, so it must still be above 1 degree. We knew it was a little warmer here in the bay, but that did not help, because we would lie if we would subtract like a couple of degrees. The etchings on our silicon were not made that way. They were simple: just measure and record. We love that simplicity. We rarely get “injuries” like my cousin has at the moment. We would love the other to begin to trust our experience and the inaccuracies of nature. Some things cannot be measured. The sunrises for example. But I am getting carried away again…
