# WIP: Readinglist week 6 2021

_This is an initial post in a series to record what I read during my research. It will have a linked BibTex fiel in the future to make the material sharable more easily. Also, I hop to put some quotes, in here, etc._

This week I am reading:

## cont. _Designing with the Body_, Kristina Höök, MIT Press

## _The uncontrollability of the World_, Harmut Rosa, engl. Translation, Polity Press, Cambridge

The original book was published in German as _Unverfügbarkeit_, Residenz Verlag, Salzburg


## How to do Nothing, Jenni Ordell

## influx and eflux, Jane Bennett
