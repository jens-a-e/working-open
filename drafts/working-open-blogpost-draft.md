Notes on ~~working~~ being “open”

The post will reflect on different aspects from open leadership training over tools and ways of working open, concrete action and impact on the own way of working, and how I relate my current research lens to the learning.

Sharing process, insights

What to open and to whom? A recurring question even before the 

## Generative Things vs Internet Appliances

Open-ended and generative devices vs internet appliances is a framing by Jonathan Zittrain @zittrainFutureInternetHow2008 I was made aware of in a conversation with Mehan Jayasuriya. With more and more products increasingly becoming appliances to access services and consume carefully considered bits of insights form the analysis of ones data, devices that enable us to generate and create outcomes on our own disappear. Our agency disappears with it. When Zittrain suggests to become better _netizens_ what does it mean for the space of the Internet of Things on and around the body?

To reflect how aspects of open and working open are part of my own research I would like to introduce two of the concepts that have been developed as a response to a participatory research study. In the study I asked participants to use an object they can find at home as an imaginary wearable Internet of Things device. To document their ideas and reflections they had to (re-)create a folded manual they had supposedly lost before.
The design of the study is based on the concept of Design Probes. Design Probes are objects literally probing the participants experiences, reflections and ideas on a prompt. They are usually an unfinished—so to speak open—piece which is completed through the response of the person or group.

The second concept _Haptic Memories_ is a response to one of the imagined devices a reminder for physical activity which turned into a musical instrument prompting the wearer to literally play in movement. The well-being device turned instrument sparked an open reflection between the participant and me why such utilitarian and optimising devices lack a joy and playful quality. Playing the device as a response to the physically unhealthy behaviour is open-ended. Most importantly the participant remarked the experience is made _in time_ in contrast to looking at statistics of e.g. how many minutes of movement one has completed today and how good the ratio is for example. Even a beautiful rich visual representation is consumed passively.
I responded to this idea with a concept of a pen where the ink is released in the rhythmic pattern of general health data, e.g. the steps taken within the last month. This results in a respectively patterned line. Ideally the ink would be physical ink but, well, a digital version should also work. To gain another rather unusual but equally ineffable quality in time the pen (or draing device) would vibrate during drawing according to the rhythms of the underlying data. The pen might seem useless as a utility to writing a note of course. I have no idea if writing a text would be readable in the end. Neither would it be reproducible. However, these are exactly the qualities of openness and resonance that are missing in the solutions created by the industry. Its purpose is a reflection of one’s own health data in an open and playful way _in time_. Its purpose is not to replace quantified analysis which is helpful in its own way. Drawing a daily sketch with the pen until the ink of steps runs out provides a way of keeping an open mind about data and the body I hope.


The IoT Tailor
This is a classic example of open hardware, making, sharing knowledge through craft, and as such drawing on many already present initiatives, communities, and movements in a deeply respectful “remix”: a tailor shop for wearable internet of things … uhm … things.

I find it comparably easy to argue for the 

## Learning form the Open Leadership Training

The Internet Health at Mozilla phase of the OpenDoTT project started with a training in Open Leadership [add link]. I enjoyed the course getting to know a structure and strategy that helps to start open projects and support community engagement early on. The course is a good resource to get going and make projects actionable. But is it similarly suited for the kind of research I am in?

Openness and the Self?

Wearables and openness?
