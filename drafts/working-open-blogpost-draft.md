# Notes on ~~working~~ un-learning “open”

The post will reflect on different aspects from open leadership training over tools and ways of working open, concrete action and impact on the own way of working, and how I relate my current research lens to the learning.

Overall the Open Leadership Training material, our discussions, and the significant turn of open as a paradigm to justice has resulted for me in realising that _un-learning_ open is the most interesting outcome. How to unlearn then? I have only a slight idea. However, I would like to start to share more of my process, my insights, and ideas through notes, short posts, and making things. Sharing it as an accessible resource on the web. I feel I learned a lot by openly accessible literature, projects, or notes by others. Contrary to the [Open Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fjA-itbypzc75AeoxZhK9GXgyXrkGf0lyvmhjyyu61Q/edit#slide=id.p) I created as suggested by the training, wouldn’t it be good to contribute rather than to start a new project?

What to open and to whom? My fellow fellow [Felipe](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) made

How to open and make fair.

Unlearning open by listening.

Open as honest. Honest design of trusted things.

Being in the open.

Resonance and open.

Frame previous work as suggesting a sense of resonance.

What does the reflection suggest?

So what?

## Generative Things vs Internet Appliances

Open-ended and generative devices vs internet appliances is a framing by Jonathan Zittrain [-@zittrainFutureInternetHow2008] I was made aware of in a conversation with my supervisor Mehan Jayasuriya. With more and more products increasingly becoming appliances to access services and consume carefully considered bits of insights form the analysis of ones data, devices that enable us to generate and create outcomes on our own disappear. Our agency disappears with it. When Zittrain suggests to become better _netizens_, what does it mean for the space of the Internet of Things on and around the body? Should become better carers of things?

To reflect how aspects of open and working open are part of my own research I would like to introduce two of the concepts that have been developed as a response to a participatory research study. In the study I asked participants to use an object they can find at home as an imaginary wearable Internet of Things device. To document their ideas and reflections of what is was, how it would work, and why they had it participants had to (re-)create a folded manual which was supposedly lost before.
The design of the study is based on the concept of Design Probes. Design Probes are objects literally probing the participants experiences, reflections and ideas on a prompt in order to generate new insights on a research subject. They are usually an unfinished—so to speak open-ended—piece which is completed through the response of the person or group.

Let’s start with the concept _Haptic Memories_ is a response to one of the imagined devices a reminder for physical activity which turned into a musical instrument prompting the wearer to literally play in movement. The well-being device turned instrument sparked an open reflection between the participant and me why such utilitarian and optimising devices lack a joy and playful quality. Playing the device as a response to the physically unhealthy behaviour is open-ended. Most importantly the participant remarked the experience is made _in time_ in contrast to looking at statistics of e.g. how many minutes of movement one has completed today and how good the ratio is for example. Even a beautiful rich visual representation is consumed passively.
I responded to this idea with a concept of a pen where the ink is released in the rhythmic pattern of general health data, e.g. the steps taken within the last month. This results in a respectively patterned line. Ideally the ink would be physical ink but, well, a digital version should also work. To gain another rather unusual but equally ineffable quality in time the pen (or draing device) would vibrate during drawing according to the rhythms of the underlying data. The pen might seem useless as a utility to writing a note of course. I have no idea if writing a text would be readable in the end. Neither would it be reproducible. However, these are exactly the qualities of openness and resonance that are missing in the solutions created by the industry. Its purpose is a reflection of one’s own health data in an open and playful way _in time_. Its purpose is not to replace quantified analysis which is helpful in its own way. Drawing a daily sketch with the pen until the ink of steps runs out provides a way of keeping an open mind about data and the body, I hope.

The other concept described IoT Tailors as a normal shop in villages, towns, and cities. It builds on the classic example of open hardware, making, sharing knowledge through craft, and as such drawing on many already present initiatives, communities, and movements in a deeply respectful “remix”: a tailor shop for wearable internet of things … uhm … things.
The concept consciously avoided to be innovative with a _genuinely new_ thing but to ask what if institutions we already know would adjust to the technological advances and continued their practice in an open way. What would happen if wearable IoT would be _make-able_ by many more than a few big corporations. Yes, this isn’t something new per-se. And it isn’t a spectacular concept. My hope is that in this space of unspectacular wearable Internet of Things a longer lived relationship towards sustainability and agency for the individual and communities can emerge. And, in a way it would be spectacular as of now to have an IoT Tailor open down the road, wouldn’t it?

## Learning form the Open Leadership Training

Reflecting on the training

The Internet Health at Mozilla phase of the OpenDoTT project started with a training in Open Leadership [@mozillafoundationOpenLeadershipTraining]. I enjoyed the course getting to know a structure and strategy that helps to start open projects and support community engagement early on. The course is a good resource to get going and make projects actionable. But is it similarly suited for the kind of research I am in?


## A look at the open fields ahead

Taking a rest.

Describe the view from where I stand.

What do i see.

The new tilt is to write the story like a wanderer across open fields. After a long walk across the plains of design research with different oasis, villages, big cities, strong winds, and all sorts of weather the hills of technology lie ahead. Taking a break and taking stock on the provisions.

What do I pick along the way. A good chunk of open technology.

Openness and the Self? Wearables and openness?

Let’s subsume this as personal informatics
