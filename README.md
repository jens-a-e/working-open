# Working Open

A meta repository of thoughts, notes, and links on working open.

Welcome to my journey of working open. This collection of thoughts, ideas, notes, and links is an effort to make my personal learnings more accessible. It also marks a the time when we--the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org)--started the project phase of [Internet Health](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/internet-health/).

_Working open_ is an essential part of this.

I have worked open before in a way, publishing code on Github https://github.com/jens-a-e and https://github.com/muthesius and on Gitlab https://gitlab.com/maschinentexte and https://gitlab.com/opendott/was.

The aim of this endeavour is to share while I am working and invite critique and feedback form a wider audience.

This is the start.

# Projects

- I have to improve my writing, so I am thinking of:
    - Starting a weekly / monthly newsletter
    - Starting a blog as a publish notebook
