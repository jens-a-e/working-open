# Working Open

An umbrella repository containing thoughts, notes, and links on working open in the OpenDoTT project.

Welcome to my journey of working open. This collection of thoughts, ideas, notes, and links is an effort to make my personal learning more accessible. It also marks a the time when we—the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org)—started the project phase of [Internet Health](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/internet-health/).

_Working open_ is an essential part of this.

I have worked in the open before in a way, publishing code on Github https://github.com/jens-a-e and https://github.com/muthesius and on Gitlab https://gitlab.com/maschinentexte and https://gitlab.com/opendott/was.

The aim of this endeavour is to share while I am working and invite critique and feedback form a wider audience.

This is the start.

Reasoning

- I have to improve my writing, so I am thinking of:
    - Starting a weekly / monthly newsletter
        - a platform or a homegrown crafted list?
            - Using the Tinyletter platform?
              - Candidate for a first blog post?
              - Popular
            - What about GDPR and services storing those addresses?
            - Start simple and apparent?
              - Create a `mailto:` link to my email address for subscription and process manually
              - A mailing list on sourcehut.org could be a next step
        - Mehan had a good point: it is easy for people to get in touch, just an email reply away
        - It would be good to train regular publishing
    - A simple weblog as a public notebook in a simple sense
        - Fellow fellow Felipe has an amazing blog: https://is.efeefe.me/opendott
        - It would be a good continuity exercise which I am not sure I can keep up
- I love plain text writing, the ease and the light editors that come with it. I started a resource how to do this https://github.com/jens-a-e/trying-to-use-academic-markdown and hope people might contribute to make academic writing in plain text easier and fun
