## Other pages

As this little garden will evolve here are some first resources:

- A more detailed description of my research project: [https://opendott.org/self/](https://opendott.org/self/)
- A repository of notes on _working open_: [https://open.poetic.systems/readme/](https://open.poetic.systems/readme/) with the source on [https://git.sr.ht/~jens/working-open](https://git.sr.ht/~jens/working-open)
- More to follow

As part of the research I am interested in low tech approaches. Hence, for now this page is intentionally left as simple HTML with a bit of style following bit by bit.
