# Field Notes on Exploring Resonant Internet of Things on and around the Body


This is a gateway page to notes, thoughts, code, public documentation and reflection on the PhD research on _Wearables and the Self_ as part of the [Open Design of Trusted Things (OpenDoTT)](https://opendott.org) project.

If you want to get in touch, feel free to drop me an email: [jens.a.ewald@northumbria.ac.uk](mailto:jens.a.ewald@northumbria.ac.uk)

OpenDoTT is a EU H2020 funded joint project of the [University of Northumbria School of Design](https://northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/academic-departments/northumbria-school-of-design/), Newcastle and the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/).

As the page will evolve as an gate to a growing digital garden here are first resources:

- A more detailed description of my research project: [https://opendott.org/self/](https://opendott.org/self/)
- A repository of notes on _working open_: [https://open.poetic.systems/readme/](https://open.poetic.systems/readme/) with the source on [https://git.sr.ht/~jens/working-open](https://git.sr.ht/~jens/working-open)
- More to follow

As part of the research I am interested in low tech approaches. Hence, for now this page is intentionally left as simple HTML with a bit of style following bit by bit.
