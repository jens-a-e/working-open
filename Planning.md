# Reasoning

- I have to improve my writing, so I am thinking of:
    - Starting a weekly / monthly newsletter
        - a platform or a homegrown crafted list?
            - Using the Tinyletter platform?
              - Candidate for a first blog post?
              - Popular
            - What about GDPR and services storing those addresses?
            - Start simple and apparent?
              - Create a `mailto:` link to my email address for subscription and process manually
              - A mailing list on sourcehut.org could be a next step
        - Mehan had a good point: it is easy for people to get in touch, just an email reply away
        - It would be good to train regular publishing
    - A simple weblog as a public notebook in a simple sense
        - Fellow fellow Felipe has an amazing blog: https://is.efeefe.me/opendott
        - It would be a good continuity exercise which I am not sure I can keep up
- I love plain text writing, the ease and the light editors that come with it. I started a resource how to do this https://github.com/jens-a-e/trying-to-use-academic-markdown and hope people might contribute to make academic writing in plain text easier and fun
