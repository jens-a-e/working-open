Installed a Wireguard server on a cheap cloud server instance using the [Nyr/wireguard-install](https://github.com/Nyr/wireguard-install).

It was surpisingly easy to get up and running â€” ok, after a kernel update, but that is due to my old-ish server.

Reason I mention this here is that it could prove useful when deploying connected probes to participants. The VPN would make runnig servers exposed to the public internet obsolete and it could even be a machine in the researcher's studio.

A good resource for detaisl was also this article: https://dev.to/miguelmota/getting-started-with-wireguard-n9e

And to get a newer kernel with hardware enabling things (HWE) this resource showed how to do it on my old Ubuntu 18.04LTS: https://itsfoss.com/ubuntu-hwe-kernel/

Bottom line is to run `sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-18.04` (on a desktop machine there would be another package for XServer) and the to `reboot`.
