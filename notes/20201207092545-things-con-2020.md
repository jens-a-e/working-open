workshop notes

morning: getting things to work
afternoon: ideate your personal display

setup the phonegrown for ourselves

https://www.instructables.com/Turn-an-Unused-Smartphone-Into-a-Smart-Display/

connecting the code form the webapp and o the site feels a bit weird

could this become a decentralised version with the code running on the phone itself using dat?

had to do the IFTTT again

note to self: instructions would benefit from having a short overview and reasoning at the beginning of eac step.

more detailed examples would help

e.g. create a folder on top of your Google Drive named “PhoneGrown”

it is very tedious!

from the supervision:

what are the realistic barriers.

how this undermines poetry?

back after lunch

“the tutorial works only with a certain amount of oldness”—from the chat as a participant tries to find a phone or tablet that can work with the website

what does it mean to remix?
