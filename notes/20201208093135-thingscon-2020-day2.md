choppy audio makes for a slow start

uploading the presentation might solve the audio problems because sharing the screen does not peak the cpu usage, hence the fan does not vent heavily, therefore the noise reduction algorithm doe snot chop up the spoken word.

the upload limit is 30MB for the pdf :) so, low tech presentation would be great, wouldnâ€™t it?
