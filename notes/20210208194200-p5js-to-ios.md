# Short notes on moving form P5js to iOS/mobile apps

Within the epxloration of making data accessible in other forms, I started to pursue what I framed earlier as _Haptic Memories_. [Here is a note on how I started the code work](./20201130180325-haptic-memories-prototyping).

**If you intersted in trying out the drawing iOS application, [please get in touch](mailto:jens.a.ewald@northumbria.ac.uk)**.

# To speed up trying out different forms of _ink_

A collection of p5js sketches: https://editor.p5js.org/jens-a-e/collections/CIF6uL6o8

[Click here to launch the web version of the latest sketch.](https://editor.p5js.org/jens-a-e/present/v6paYO0wX)

The sketch uses actual recording of steps from me personally. The data from 3 consecutive days was queried by _steps per minute_.

Simply start drawing and maybe start again. It is not about undestanding the data in a way to count steps and compute statisitcs or a graph or visualise my behaviour in a transparent representation.

The aim of this exploration is to create other forms of reflection through activity in and over time. Taking data as ink for a virtua pen enables a momentum of different understanding.

# Moving code from the sketching environment to other devices

In order to move the drawing back on the phone—where it started because fo the haptic feedback—I am trubing to find ways to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) in order to keep the platform isolation as low as possible.

Do I need to use a webview to load the p5js sketch?

Here is a forum thread on inlcuding p5js into React: https://discourse.processing.org/t/using-react-with-p5-js-es6-support/3298/3 and ReactNative: https://discourse.processing.org/t/p5-js-in-react-native/12181/3

Options

- I could use proecssing.js with the mentioned ReactNative component: https://github.com/expo/expo-processing
- Look at the component above and do it for p5js
    - someone must have attempted this?
- Expo/ReactNative has basic support for haptic feedback; should create a quick test
- Use [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc)
