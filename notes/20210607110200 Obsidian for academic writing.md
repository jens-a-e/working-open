This is a note on reasons behind and how to set up Obsidian for academic Markdown.

---

Why Markdown and Obsidian for academic writing?

- Quick to write
- Plain text format
- Free Software
- Pandoc for the conversion
- Easier and lighter than LaTex

Obsidian

- Not a code editor
- Lightweight
- local install of plugins and themes makes crossing to other machines easier
- Bib CSL-JSON support for refs
  - e.g. exported from Zotero with Better BibTex
- multi pane layouts
- linkable docs
- keep notes and other files besides the writing docs
- There is a Git plugin to help with using Git
