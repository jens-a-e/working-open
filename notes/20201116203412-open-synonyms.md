On a higher level the meaning is grouped as:

* unfastened, unclosed
* accessible; not forbidden
* clear, obvious
* undecided
* honest, objective

From all of the above _honest and objective_ have an interesting quality to them. Letâ€™s try: working honest, working objective, objective source, honest source, honest hardware; I would like honest hardware, code, and practice wearable Internet of Things. I belief it has more potential to be trusted than a secret subjective silicon on and around my body.

The other scopes also give a twist to the familiar.
