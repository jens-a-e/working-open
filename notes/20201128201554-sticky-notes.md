I have benefited from open source in the past. How can I contribute back?

Being Open

Being open to the doing of things

What have I learned?

How to choose what tools for open and just writing?

Choice of tools and utilities and practice is a first step to close in.
The naming of things is excluding the thing from other things.

Is the ineffable open per se? If a thing is not named is it open?


Open as in Open Minded.

Wgat have I learned?

Living Documents.
Versioning.
Digital Gardening.

Digital Hiking?
Taking ideas and concepts for a walk?

When open is cancelled and justice is the better aim needed to make a fundamental change for a better future, being open and stepping back for those who have spoken before without listening; they should be listening.

open as honest

unlearning open

the millions of tens of us
